 * This test is a temporary solution to verify the status code of a GET request.
 * Future improvements:
 * - Validate the response body for expected fields and data.
 * - Add error handling for different status codes.


 * Plan to reduce tech-debt:
 * 1. Add assertions to validate the response body.
 * 2. Handle different response scenarios (e.g., non-200 status codes).
 * 3. Implement data-driven testing for multiple endpoints.


 * Technical Documentation:
 * Known issue: This endpoint occasionally fails under heavy load.
 * Future plans: Optimize the method or handle retries for failed responses.


 * Technical Debt:
 * - Basic implementation, lacks detailed validation.
 * - Future enhancements: Validate response fields, handle error codes, and test with varied inputs.
